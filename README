Blobserver
==========

About
-----
Blobserver is, before anything else, an engine designed to facilitate the implementation of realtime detection algorithms. It provides a main loop which updates all activated detectors and sources (cameras basically), and outputs OSC messages related to what was detected. A few detectors are already implemented.

Installation
------------
Here is how to build and install it on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu Precise::

  sudo apt-get install help2man gettext automake bison build-essential flex libtool 
  sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev liblo0-dev
  sudo apt-get install liblcms2-dev libxml2-dev libtbb-dev
  sudo apt-get install libshmdata-0.6

We need the latest version of OpenCV, which is not yet packaged for Ubuntu. So:
  cd ..
  git clone git://code.opencv.org/opencv.git
  cd opencv
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make
  sudo make install

Then we can compile blobserver:
  cd ../../blobserver
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig
